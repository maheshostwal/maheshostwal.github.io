                            The goal of the project was to help new international students deal with food neophobia and try out new foods while adapting to the American food culture. The project involved extensive user research to understand the problem space, design a  solution through idea divergence and convergence, developing a prototype and finally evaluating the designed solution.

                            <p class="text-justify">The general problem area is the difficulties faced by new international students at US universities when they find themselves in the cafeteria staring at menus with completely unfamiliar foods. They are at their wit’s end to decide what to buy and what they might like. Along with this, once they get to know a few foods, they stick to those very foods. Getting them to go out of their comfort zone and try new foods. This inspired us to find a solution to help new international students rapidly adapt to the on-campus dining.</p>

These are students pursuing their Bachelor's or Masters or Doctorate. Not familiar with the foods available in the on-campus restaurants as they are new to America and its fod culture, they have a difficult time choosing and deciding what to buy for each meal.</p><br/><br/>

                            To familiarize ourselves with the process a new international student went through at the dining places to decide and buy a meal, we began with this method. Each of the sessions lasted half an hour at the various on-campus dining places.

                            <strong>2. Task Analysis </strong>- Based on the naturalistic observations and the contextual inquiries, we came up with the task analysis diagram to gain a proper understanding of the process the new international students go through on a regular basis to decide and order food at the on-campus restaurants.<br/>

                            For ordering food, the task flow varies according to the dining place:<br/>
                            <strong>Cafeteria:</strong>
                            This dining place requires people to interact with one or more servers. People move along the line to order. There is typically a menu, but the food are displayed behind the counter and serve as a more obvious reference. This means that users could either communicate with words or by pointing to the food displayed.<br/>
                            <strong>Fast food store: </strong>
                            This dining place usually has only one window to place order and check out. The only reference is the menu.<br/>
                            <strong>Buffet:</strong>
                            This dining place has open windows with no servers in most cases. Users could pick food on their own, without communicating with others. There is often no menu, but name tags of food.<br/><br/>

                            However tasks carried out at different dining places have some characteristics in common:<br/></p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Time is usually limited. This means that users have to take actions or make decisions under pressure. The social pressure of having other people waiting behind the user creates a negative incentive to avoid asking too many questions or taking time to consider the menu.</li>
                            <li>The options are limited. This means that users make decisions considering a few items.</li>
                            <li>Information about food and process is provided but the display area is rather small. This means that users can not get very detailed information unless they reach out to people or internet.</li>
                            <li>The environment is usually noisy. This means that the quality of verbal interaction is usually reduced.</li>
                            <li>The space is usually crowded with people, who are most likely in a hurry as well. This means that users have little privacy in the process, and have to care about others’ opinions.</li>

                            We followed up the naturalistic observations with contextual inquiries. We conducted several contextual inquiries with international students from different parts of the world. This was to gain further insights into the behavior of the students and the various things they consider when deciding about the food to buy. The naturalistic observations helped us understand “what” the students do while the contextual inquiries helped us understand “why” the students do what they do. We accompanied them to either the restaurants or the dining services where buffets are served. All the while, we kept picking their brains as to understand the user behavior in detail and comprehend their habits etc. Once we had the notes from the several contextual inquiries we conducted, we made an affinity mapping to analyze the huge amount of data we had gathered. A number of insights were uncovered from this form of analysis.

A number of insights related to user needs, priorities and behavior were uncovered from this form of analysis.<br/>

                            <li>
                            2) Peers’ opinions and advice is valued and the crowd in general has influence on the food choices people make at the cafeteria.

                            <li>

                                As we did the contextual inquiries with a number of participants from the target user group, there was a need to confirm our findings with a larger user group.
                                Following up on the affinity mapping process, we created a short survey with  asking our participants to rate their experiences with the on-campus eating options, the difficulty level with the deciding and ordering process, whether they are interested in trying out new foods, under what circumstances they’d try new foods, whether they are open to trying out new foods in the first place etc. This was to find the 3 biggest issues and filter out the other findings that were not as important. We received more than 60 valid responses from international students, both old and new. We had distributed the survey on social media platforms and also by word of mouth. The survey results were then analyzed using basic statistical methods along with comparing and contrasting to unearth further insights into user behavior, choices and habits.

<strong>6. Personas </strong>-
For our personas we analyzed our design needs and recommendations and compared those with the feedback we received from our interviews and surveys. We matched our personas to the broad trends we perceived in our data. We were able to identify three different major personas from these trends. There were also minor data points that while they would not factor in our major design decisions, we wanted to include these to give some accuracy,  richness, and variety to our personas. The major personality factors included length of stay in America, introversion/ extroversion, and eating habits. The minor factors included wanting healthy foods and country of origin.  These are minor because while the country of origin could influence cultural expectations and the language barrier of students, we found these to be common problems.  The common factors between students were price, identifying foods, friends recommendations, understanding menu information, understanding procedure, and minimizing interaction with the serving staff. There were however different levels of influence that determined which of these would be a focus for each persona.<br/><br/>
Primary Persona <br/>
The first persona is Yan, a young chinese woman who has been in the United States for 6 months. Compared to other new students, Yan is a little more introverted and less likely to ask questions in the process of ordering. She is much more aware of the social consequences of trying to order and doesn’t wish to take a lot of time in that process. Yan would much rather have a plan ahead of time when going to order.  Her response to the anxieties from trying to order results in her being more likely to skip a restaurant that she can’t understand the foods and menu for. Her personal solution to this problem is to rely on friends who have already gone through this process to either order for her or provide recommendations. However, she would like to try new foods, just that the difficulty in understanding what they are means that she would rather not without sufficient information.<br/>
For both of our personas that have been in the US for a shorter time there are a few common characteristics. Yan places a higher priority on knowing what foods actually are, and if she would find them tasty. There is a higher priority for her on knowing ingredients and the healthiness of the foods she is eating. Health is a very minor concern (only relevant for a few users who were surveyed, but we wanted to make sure they were represented in our personas). There was a behavior we saw in the chinese students in our field studies. We noticed several times that in groups often one would order food in front of the others. Then the students behind the first student would then order exactly the same food choices as the first student. What we inferred was that the second student relied on the experience of the first student, and was uncomfortable in making their own choices.  We wanted Yan to reflect the second student. We implied that Yan is from China for a few reasons. Chinese students make up a large proportion of our international student population. Our research indicated that any language barrier was not a major factor. While it exists, the cultural expectations of the ordering process are more of an issue. <br/>
We made Yan as our primary persona because she has the most difficulty in adapting to dining on campus.  She represents a large group of people that we should be a major focus of our design choices.<br/>
Secondary Persona 1<br/>
The second persona is Ram from India. He has been in the United States for 1 and a half years. Ram is meant to represent certain trends that we noticed in our data. What we found in our research was that despite being in the US for a year or two, international students were still unfamiliar with American foods and uncertain about the process of ordering. This means that Ram shares many of the same problems as the first persona. The major difference is how he responds to the problems he has when he visits restaurants. Ram is more outgoing and less concerned with asking questions and taking his time ordering.  Whereas Yan, the primary persona, worries about inconveniencing others in a social setting, Ram is more concerned with spending as much time as possible to make sure his meal is right. The unfortunate consequence that we found was when ordering the talking back-and-forth to the server only reveals more issues and causes more confusing in the ordering process. This means that by asking questions Ram may actually make his chances worse of getting a meal he wants.<br/>
We added a few more minor characteristics we found in our research to differentiate Ram from the other personas and make sure our design adequately addresses the needs of all our users. We made Ram very outgoing and social.  Where the first persona may bring a friend or two because she is unsure and needs someone to rely on, Ram is a social eater and maybe would be found with a larger group just because he enjoys the company. For both of our personas that have been in the US for a shorter time there are a few common characteristics. Ram places a higher priority on knowing what foods actually are, and if he would find them tasty.  While Ram is willing to try foods, he may not like them and is often disappointed when he orders something that isn’t like what he wanted. It is important for him to find good foods that he understands and can relate his tastes to. Friends’ recommendations and understanding the menu are important as for all personas.  Ram sits between the other two personas for knowing the procedure, as he doesn’t understand it but is willing to ask questions augment his gaps in knowledge. Price information is a concern, but Ram, like the first persona, prioritizes tasty and familiar foods over price.<br/>
We made Ram from India because students from India represent another significant portion of international students at Georgia Tech. Our research indicated that any language barrier was not a major factor, instead the cultural expectations of the ordering process are more of an issue. This persona represents the expectations of Indian students and their cultural expectations when ordering food.<br/>
Secondary Persona 2<br/>
For our second persona we wanted to take many of the opposite characteristics and user trends that we found in our research and contrast those with the primary persona.  Secondary persona 2, or Pablo, is a graduate student from Colombia that has lived in the United States for over 3 years. He could be considered more of an “expert user” among international students. Pablo has been in the US long enough that he is familiar with common American foods and the cultural process of ordering. He still has several difficulties, but Pablo has different priorities than the other personas. He also may have an advantage that came up during one of our contextual inquiries, where he could speak English or Spanish to the server to get a better idea of what he was ordering. Pablo is more of a connoisseur and wants to try new and tasty foods. His issue is that many times when he tries something new, the food is not good. Many of these experiences means that Pablo is not eating the variety of foods that he would like.<br/>
Pablo has many of the same concerns as the other personas, but places a different priority on these concerns. Pablo is more influenced by price information, and coupons and sales may be more effective incentives.  He already knows what many common foods are, and is much more interested in trying new tasty foods.  He also relies on his friends for food information. However, where the other personas use friends to know what foods are, Pablo uses their information to suggest what foods are good to eat and what’s new to try. Like the other two personas, Pablo needs much better menu information to understand what foods restaurants are offering.<br/>
We implied that Pablo is from Columbia. Hispanic students make a smaller proportion of Georgia Tech’s international population, but are present. Potentially if this study was expanded, they also would make a larger portion of the student population at other colleges and universities. We wanted a persona that would have some familiarity with “American” culture, but still be different enough to provide insight into our problem space. By having a persona that is very adept and almost lacks a language barrier, we aim to focus on solving the issues of differences expectations when ordering.<br/>

Each preceding user research method informed us about the next method to use. Once we had the results from the survey, we analyzed the data to determine the top 3 concerns of international students. The most important user needs that were discovered from the research methods and confirmed by the survey were:<br/> 
                            1. The high reliance on friends for food recommendations and the high trust factor between each other<br/>
                            2. The overwhelming willingness of the students to try out new foods<br/>
                            3. The knowledge of foods and what they taste like<br/>
                            4. Detailed information about the foods that are displayed on the menu<br/>
                            5. The procedure of ordering foods, as in, to try a subway sandwich, the person has to first choose the type of bread, then the cheese, toppings etc.<br/> 
                            6. Price information – as students are hard pressed for money, price is an even more important factor in making the food choice<br/>
                            Keeping these user needs in mind we had two brainstorming sessions spread over a couple days. All kinds of ideas that would help in resolving the user needs were thought of.  In total we had around 40 ideas and some of them were overlapping<br/><br/>
                                
                            <h3> Idea Convergence</h3>
                            We combined the overlapping ideas and were left with a reduced list of about 20-25 ideas. These were then put to vote based on their feasibility and impact.<br/><br/>

                                <strong>1. A social network of friends where the app suggests foods based on the user’s and his friends' preferences and tastes  </strong> - The users can rate their experiences with the various foods they have tried on campus and this is shared with their friends. Along with this, friends can arrange sampling sessions to try out foods with large servings that are too big just to be sampled by a single person. The ratings can then be further filtered based on the country of origin of the reviewers etc.<br/></p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><strong>2. The Augmented Reality menu </strong> – The idea here was to provide the user with a state-of-the-art augmented reality version of the menu. The user would be able to perceive the texture of the food on drilling down and could also further see the various ingredients, the reviews by his/her friends etc. The expanded experience where the user doesn’t have to repeatedly peer into his phone searching online for the items on the menu. This was a high impact idea but not as feasible. We decided to keep an ambitious idea to be open to novel designs for the proceeding stages of the design process. </p><br/>

A game app where the whole process of learning about the American food culture and the various foods, both local and international were gamified</strong> - The user would win points for trying out new foods and at the same time can learn about new foods tried by their friends. Along with these, there is a game to discover the on-campus eating-places. The whole process of learning and discovering foods and then trying them out is transformed into a fun activity. Food roulette suggests random foods that they need to try which will get them points.</p>

                            <h3> The Final Design Idea</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Some of the better design decisions from the design sprint which will be included in the P3 prototype are:<br/>
                            <strong>1. A food roulette</strong> - which suggests foods to the user based on his likes and preferences. In the registration page, he is asked to check mark all the foods that he likes from his native cuisine as well as from other cuisines. Based on these, the app suggests the user to try foods through the roulette. The user flicks the roulette and then is shown the food that the roulette stopped at. This is to bring an element of surprise and fun and take away the dilemma that the student would again find himself or herself in because it is difficult to choose between foods that you haven’t tried yet. <br/>
                            <strong>2. Recommendations from friends</strong> - From our surveys and contextual inquiries, we gathered that friends are an integral part of student life and how they go about trying new foods and the amount of trust they place in their friends recommendations. Peer opinions are highly valued. We are using this important insight and incorporating it in our prototype in a big way. Here, friends can share the foods they like with each other and also recommend it to their friends. It also has a feedback mechanism where they can communicate with their friend whether they liked the food they recommended or not.<br/>
                            <strong>3. The ordering process</strong> is simulated in the app where the user goes through the exact steps that he would go through were he ordering at the restaurant. For example, if the person were at Subway ordering a Veggie Delite, the app shows the same procedure where he selects the type of bread, the cheese, the toppings and finally the sauce. This helps the student experience the exact process and know what to expect at the restaurant. If the person wants to order in person he is guided to the restaurant or else it can be ordered as well using our app.<br/> 
                            <strong>4. The recommendations come through two routes</strong> - One is the app scours its database-using machine learning to find foods that the person might like based on the person’s preferences. It also matches the person’s tastes with the likes of people with similar tastes and suggests foods that the user hasn’t tried but has been tried and liked by the other people. The other form of recommendations come directly from people in his friends circle. The friends can recommend a food and if liked by the recipient he might reward the friend, otherwise throw back the food at him.
                            Some of the other important design decisions that are included in the prototype is the functionality to filter and be able to see ratings by people from the same country, wish list, tried foods history etc. <br/>

                            <h3> Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                            <br/>The heuristic evaluation was conducted on a low-fi prototype to see whether the design satisfies the Nielsen and Molich Heuristic Evaluation criteria while making the interations fast. This helped us to remove the obvious and subtle potential user issues right in the beginning of the evaluation process.<br/>
                            <p class="text-justify">
                            <h3> Usability Testing</h3>
                            After the heuristic evaluation, we built a high fidelity prototype and sought feedback from our target user group, the new international students at Georgia Tech. The participant is shown our app prototype and then asked to perform a series of benchmark tasks. The benchmark tasks were formed keeping in mind the user needs and the functionalities our app provides based on those needs. 
                            Some of the potential benchmark tasks are as follows:<br/>
                            <strong>Task#1: Login and customize your tastes and food preferences</strong><br/>
                            <strong>Task#2: Use the roulette to try a new food</strong><br/>
                            “You are a new student to GeorgiaTech and are fed-up of eating the same food for the last  week. You want our app to pick a new food for you that you'd try.<br/>
                            Rate the foods/ Write a review. 
                            <br/>Find a new food and leave your opinion.  
                            <br/>You found a food that you think your friend John would like. Send a food recommendation to your friend".<br/>
                            <strong>Task#3: Try out a friend's recommendation</strong><br/>
                            “Hey! Your friend Yiran just recommend you a new food. Find the food and try the new food. Also give your friend some feedback"<br/>
                            <strong>Task#4 Order food from a restaurant</strong><br/>
                            “You have just entered Moe’s and don’t know how to order or what the foods are. Learn more about it.”<br/>
                            
                            <br/> After the usability tests comprising the benchmark tasks, the users were asked questions based on Subjective reaction metrics and User Engagement Scale as the app features game like functions. 
                            <br/> Finally, the usability test participants were accompanied to an on-campus restaurant and were made to place an order with the help of our app.
                            <br/><br/></p>
                            
                            
                            <h2> Future Design Iterations</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Some parts of the tasks the users struggled with are as follows:<br/>
                            <strong>Roulette</strong> - Even though the user was able to identify the roulette promptly on the app screen, he revealed in the post task questionnaire that the roulette icon could be improved upon as it is not very conspicuous and it hides some text on the app screen. <br/>  
                            <strong>Avatar</strong> - Though the user is aware of the concept of Avatars used in computer games, the user was not able to fully identify the use of the avatar in the case of our app. The purpose of the avatar was not very obvious to them.<br/>
                            <strong>The speaker icon present in each step of the ordering process screen</strong>  - The user at first thought that on tapping the speaker icon, the app will speak on behalf of them and the user is only supposed to take it near the server and play it to them to go through the ordering process in person at the restaurant. The intended functionality of the feature was to help the user get the pronunciation right and reduce their cognitive burden by just repeating the very sentence to the server at the restaurant. Although this is a positive unintended use case of the feature, nonetheless the original functionality was not straightaway discovered by the user. The user also opined that it might be an accessibility function to help blind users know the names of the foods they have ordered or even to help speech impaired users order the food at the restaurant through the app.<br/>
                            <strong>Recommending foods to friends after trying them out</strong> - The user explained to us that they are not comfortable sending personal recommendations to friends. They would rather post the recommendation on social media if need be but not send personal recommendations to friends. This is not a limitation or flaw in our design as there are different types of users and the intention is to cater to the largest user base and this is just a case of personal preference. If the user so desires, it would be nice to have them opt out of this feature.<br/>
                            <strong>The check mark with the new try text and the coins on the Review and Recommendation page</strong> - The user had some difficulty in understanding the meaning and the use of the coins and the ‘new foods tried’ points. They wanted to know what these meant as the meaning of these were not obvious to them. Also being familiar with games, they were aware of the concept of points and coins but were not sure how they could use this in the context of the app. 
                            Getting to the home page - Once the user set the preferences, they were led to the Avatar page. The Avatar page is the home screen of the app and lists out the level of the user, the number of coins and coupons earned and the number of new foods tried among other avatar customization options. The user arrived at this screen and still explores and tries to figure out how to get to the home screen of the app. The user expected that they would be greeted with a welcome message when they finish setting the food preferences.<br/>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="text-justify">From the usability testing sessions, we gathered feedback and uncovered several problems in our prototype. Here are several key insights:<br/>
                            <strong>Positive feedback on overall usability and engagement: </strong>
                            We calculated the ratings for system usability scale as well as the user engagement scale respectively (Table 13 and 14). The average SUS score is 3.8 out of 5, and the average UES score is 4 out of 5. There are still space for improvement, but generally participants report good experience using the prototype, and have positive attitudes toward this two measures.<br/>

                            <strong>Roulette, Procedure and Recommendations are three star features:</strong>
                            We conducted qualitative analysis based on usability testing observations and comments (Table 15). Three out of four participants regard roulette, ordering procedure and recommendations from friends as very helpful features. This result is consistent with our expectation, because from our user research we have found that our users have great need for 1. Trying new food; 2. Knowing the procedure; 3. Get recommendation from friends. These three needs are addressed respectively by the three features recognized by the participants. This means that our design have the potential to effectively help our users solve their dining problems.<br/>

                            <strong>Game elements are appreciated but calls for modifications:</strong>
                            Both the usability testing and previous informal evaluations show that our users like the engaging interactions provided in the app. Almost all participants express their affection towards the “Throw-back” feature, and want more interactions to add to the interactions with friends. However, the avatar and rewards, which are designed to motivate users try more food and write more reviews in a game-like experience, received controversial feedbacks. Participants think these elements are not well-integrated in the app, making the two parts (food and game) divided. They also express confusion about how the avatars, coins or coupons work in the app. Thus, there is an urgent need to redesign the game elements, either by enhancing and clarifying the mechanism, or by reducing unnecessary elements and substitute with better motivations (e.g. peer pressure).<br/> 

                            <strong>Need for clearer instructions:</strong>
                            Customization acts as an important feature to suggest new food to users in Roulette and food list. Ideally, the algorithm should be based on users’ first time settings as well as their actions inside the app (e.g.how they rate the food). However, users do not understand how the customization work and thus feel it unnecessary. They also have no idea how the foods on the Roulette is generated. Meanwhile, 2 of the 4 users have some misunderstandings on how the procedure page work. This means that we might need some tutorial or explanations for users to understand the logic and functions of our design.<br/>

What is the problem?<br/>
		The director of the MS-HCI program feels that students need to use too many different applications to manage their HCI concerns
		Students need to be able to communicate and access information related to their academic and professional careers<br/>
Mission: Investigate MS-HCI student needs and the systems used to address those needs to develop a more comprehensive resource<br/>
                                
Who are HCI Students?<br/>

		Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at Georgia Tech
		4 Tracks of study: Interactive Computing, Industrial Design, Digital Media, and Psychology
		111 total students (56 first-year, 55 second-year)
		More than half are international students<br/>	

Research Objectives<br/>
		Understand the behaviors, attitudes, and goals of HCI students 
		Identify the information and communication needs of HCI students
		Evaluate the current systems in place to address these needs
		Determine to what extent the current systems meet these needs<br/>

Research Methods<br/>
		Ethnography<br/>
		Interview 1<br/>
		Interview 2<br/>
		Survey<br/>
Ethnography:<br/>
		Participatory observation over the course of three weeks
		Conducted in classroom and other campus environments
		Analyzed for high-level themes and direction for future research<br/>


First Set of Interviews<br/>
		6 first-year students interviewed<br/>
		Semi-structured format<br/>
		Approximately 10-minutes to complete<br/>
		Convenience sampling with screening for gender and track<br/> representation<br/>
		Data processed with Affinity Diagram<br/>

Second Set of Interviews<br/>
		6 first-year students interviewed<br/>
		Semi-structured format<br/>
		Approximately 10-minutes to complete<br/>
		Convenience sampling with screening for gender and track representation<br/>
		Data processed with Affinity Diagram<br/>


Surveys<br/>

		Created using Qualtrics website<br/>
		Distributed on Slack channel intended for HCI student survey participation<br/>
		12 questions, mix of multiple-choice, grid, Likert, and checkbox questions<br/>
		Responses from 38 HCI students (approx. one-third of program total)<br/>
		30 First-year students, 8 Second-year students<br/>
		Analyzed to confirm findings of other research and to find distinctions between groups (tracks/years/other)<br/>

Conclusion<br/>
The creation of a ‘one-stop shop’, as outlined by the Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Master’s program, is a feasible undertaking. Evidence suggests that there is a real need for a centralized resource. 
Communication tools in use are effective in meeting HCI student needs. Slack is used for this purpose by the entire program and the experience of students using this application is overwhelmingly positive. This application can be used as a foundation for the communication tool provided by the ‘one-stop shop’. 
Resource access is made difficult by the number of applications/sites involved and the limitations of class and institutional requirements. HCI students report feeling confused about the various sources needed to find important resources. A ‘one-stop shop’ should allow users to import important information found on other sites into a single, easily organized location. 
Other tools- like class information and portfolio development- are not available to students. In these cases, new resources must be developed. It is possible to build these resources by utilizing the strong peer community and preference of many students to ask peers for help. <br/>
